Expense Tracking Web App
This is a learning project to build a simple yet functional expense tracking web application from scratch. The app allows users to add and categorize their expenses, helping them manage and monitor their spending effectively.

Tech Stack
Backend: Deno2, Express 5, pg-promise
Frontend: Pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (no frameworks)
Architecture: Implemented with the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern
Type Safety: Enhanced using JSDoc
Project Goals
To deepen my understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
To gain hands-on experience with the MVC design pattern
To learn TypeScript-like type safety using JSDoc annotations
By avoiding CSS frameworks, I'm focusing on building and styling the app with minimal dependencies to gain a solid grasp of the fundamentals.
